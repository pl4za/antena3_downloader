# Antena 3 downloader

A python script the monitors for new episodes of [Bons Rapazes](https://www.rtp.pt/play/p299/)
 and [MQ3](https://www.rtp.pt/play/p255/mq3), then downloads them for offline listening.
 
Can run standalone or containerised, in something like a raspberry pi running 24/7, then combined with a file sync for Android for a seamless offline experience.
